Why'd you save me?

$Bird 0

Because we need to survive. I respect your fighting spirit.

$Tiger 0 

You should have let me die.

$Bird 0 

Why do you hate teams so much?

$Tiger 0 

The gator had me kill my friend...

Be careful Tiger, we don't know his power yet!

It's two against one, we can take him on!



$Tiger 0 

No! Snake, what happened? Oh, I don't feel so good.

$Tiger 0 

No. I don't know what happened.


$Gator 0
Idiots. So cute when friends kill each other.

This is a war for survival. Fend for yourself.

The weak deserve whatever they get. I'll win and show my true power.


$Gator 0

Now hurry up and die.


$Tiger 0 

I'll... Get you for this...

That's the last thing I remember. My only goal is to take the Gator down. 

$Tiger 0 

Alone.

$Bird 0 

Don't be silly. We know his tricks. We can take him on.

$Bird 0 

Sides... You really think you can beat him alone?

$Tiger 0 

... Okay, let's do it.
