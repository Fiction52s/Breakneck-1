I knew I sensed something. I don't know what you're planning, but you're going to die here.

Don't even think about attacking me. You're far too late for that. I've rigged the entire area
underneath your nexus with my bombs that I can set off at any time.

!??!??!?

That's right. But listen, we can be friends. I've run the numbers. The Gator and Skeleton are absolutely
too strong. They're basically guaranteed to survive, forcing the rest of us to fight for the scraps.

If things continue like this, they will simply eliminate the strongest among us, and choose the weakest to
survive into the next round along with them. Don't you hate to see those disgusting creatures manipulating
the system to stay on top? If you join us we can overthrow them, and our alliance of 3 can survive.

I already told the stupid Bird. I DON'T DO ALLIANCES. I DON'T DO FRIENDSHIPS. I'm going to destroy the gator
myself or die trying. I don't care about anything else.

You don't seem to understand the type of situation that you're in...you have two choices. Either join us,
or lose your nexus, and any hope you had of defeating the Gator in the long-term.

I won't be manipulated by your pathetic tricks, weakling. I'll kill you before you can even set those bombs off!

...Well...looks like my final gamble failed..I wanted to trust in your intelligence to make the right choice. I was
born with a weaker body than all of you, but a far superior mind. I dug tunnels underneath the entire planet before
you all had even begun expanding your territory.

This silly game would have ended with all of you dying if I hadn't been interrupted, and my nexus destroyed
without warning. The world clearly hates me. And I hate this place. I hate you. If I'm going to die here, I'm at least
taking all your hopes along with me.
