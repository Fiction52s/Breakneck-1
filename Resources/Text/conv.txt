My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine 
months ago it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very 
remarkable and most unaccountable omission: -- no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to 
be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; 
secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how 
long a period, the encroachments of Death might be arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained, 
but these most excited my curiosity -- the last in especial, from the immensely important character of its consequences.
