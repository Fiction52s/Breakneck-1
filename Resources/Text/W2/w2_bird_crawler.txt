So, we meet.

$Bird 0

We need to deal with the rogue.

$Crawler 0

He's tough... But he's no hunter, or threat to us.

$Bird 0

Right. He uses our energy.

$Crawler 0

To have any chance of winning, we have to team up

$Bird 0
Then it'll be an easy win right?

$Crawler 0

No, the Skeleton and Gator can team up against us.

$Bird 0

We need an edge.

$Crawler 0

There's the Coyote, but he's a loner. The Tiger seems best.

$Bird 0 

Alright, I'll talk with him! Let's do it!

$Crawler 0

Agreed, we've got no time to waste!
