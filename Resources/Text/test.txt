Momenta Log: Day #10

Strange crystalline energy 
structures form occassionally 
within the Transcend's range. 

As far as I can tell, these 
are thoughts or collections 
of information from within the 
Transcend that somehow leak out-

-from nearby veins temporarily,
causing them to form and then 
disintegrate. The key to truly 
understanding the Transcend is 
finding and studying these Shards.

I have developed a protocol to
read the data hidden inside the
Shards, which will be broadcast 
now, as this log completes.
