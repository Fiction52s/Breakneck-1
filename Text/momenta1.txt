Momenta Log: Day #10

$Momenta 2
Strange crystalline energy structures form occassionally within the Transcend's range. 

$Momenta 3
As far as I can tell, these are 
thoughts or collections of information from within the Transcend that somehow leak out from nearby veins temporarily, 
causing them to form and then disintegrate. 

$Momenta 4
The key to truly understanding the Transcend is finding and studying these 
Shards. 

$Momenta 5
I have developed a protocol to read the data hidden inside the Shards, which will be broadcast now, as this log 
completes.
