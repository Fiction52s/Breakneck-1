Momenta Log: Day #11

The Transcend is slowly digesting 
the entire planet. Stealing energy 
passively from the environment,
and turning any animal or plant it 
can touch into information. 

All of this stolen power collects 
in central nodes, which appear to 
transfer it directly to an energy 
nexus at the center of the activity 
in that region.

Part of the energy from each node
is siphoned off to power an energy 
shield around the nexus. Destroying 
the nodes is difficult but should 
leave the nexus vulnerable.
